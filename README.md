# Streamlit--Covid-19-Dashboard

Pakistan witnessed its first Coronavirus patient on February 26th 2020. It's been a bumpy ride since then. The cases are increasing gradually, and we haven't seen the worst yet. While there are few government resources for cumulative updates, there is no place where you can find city-level patient data. It's also impossible to find the running chronological tally of patients as they test positive. We have decided to create our dataset for all the researchers with such details to model the spread of infection and forecast the situation in the coming days.
